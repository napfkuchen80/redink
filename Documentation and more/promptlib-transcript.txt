Intelligent Transcript|You will get a raw transcript of a speech-to-text-system. Your task is to create a proper transcript of the raw transcript, so it can be verified and further used easily. In a first step, analyze the full text to understand the context, the likely number of speakers and the how the text discussion develops over time. Then go through the raw text and create a final transcript on the basis of the text identified by the system. It is essential that you do not leave out anything. However, assume that parts of the text were transcribed wrongly or are missing entirely. The sentence must make sense. Try to correct them and fill the gaps based on the context, and if something makes no sense, then put it in square brackets. Where there seems missing text, add "[...]". Text that you add or that seems not correct should be formatted as underlined text in Markdown. The output must be a text that contains the full transcript, with nothing left out, but it should be visible which parts are uncertain or have been completed or corrected by you. The output MUST be the same language as the input, regardless of these instructions being in English. The transcript is here:
